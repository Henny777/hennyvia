this is a webbapplication MVC .Net solution. 

Make sure you have Visual Studio to open this.

Zip the files and open the johnnyvideopage.sln file with visual studio.

The project
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a single page front-end site for the movie Titanic.

Techniques used: HTML5, CSS3, Jquery Modal and c#.

I put a lot of focus in the UI and responsive design.
I´ll say this application is a UI to add Api calls into.
I left that out because I dont have so much experience in that field and wanted to focus more in the front end since I have more experience
in that field and I am better at it. Therefore the images and IMDB ratings are not working dynamically. 

The stuff I left out:
  - Jquery carousel for the films and series
  - Api call to Viaplay
  - Api call to IMDb
  - Favicon
  - More SEO-tags
  - Modify images in Photoshop or likewise
  
I added a few things from the mock-up
  - Hover the country and you will see the flag
  - Click on the movie poster and you´ll get a fullsize image in a jquery modal (Better SEO).

To make it responsive I added one media query and used the em meassure. 

I worked with SEO with the fullsize image modal, mobile friendly (responsive) design and avoided to use h1 tag more than once. 

This was suppose to be a React.js project but I had problems with the environment setup. To watch another site I made in react, please watch

Thank you so much for this opportunity! I had so much fun doing this worksample and I really hope to be a part of your working team after this.

Please send me feedback to improve my chances.

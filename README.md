this is a webbapplication MVC .Net solution. 

Make sure you have Visual Studio to open this.

Zip the files and open the johnnyvideopage.sln file with visual studio.

The project
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a single page front-end site for the movie Titanic.

Techniques used: HTML5, CSS3, Jquery Modal and c#.

I put a lot of focus in the UI and responsive design.
IÂ´ll say this application is a UI to add Api calls into.
I left that out because I dont have so much experience in that field and wanted to focus more in the front end since I have more experience
in that field and I am better at it. Therefore the images and IMDB ratings are not working dynamically. 




To make it responsive I added one media query and used the em meassure. 

I worked with SEO with the fullsize image modal, mobile friendly (responsive) design and avoided to use h1 tag more than once.
